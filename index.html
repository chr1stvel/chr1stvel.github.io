	<p> <b>Zuko</b> is a Fire Nation royal and firebending master,
		he is the eldest child and only son of Princess Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.
		He is recognizable by the distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him by his father, Ozai.
		 Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost Avatar to end his banishment and <b>regain his honor as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.</b> With support from his paternal uncle, General Iroh, and after much internal struggle and turmoil, Zuko grew disillusioned and rejected Ozai and his model of the Fire Nation. He instead joined the Avatar's group to become Aang's lifelong friend and firebending mentor and was determined to end the war and restore both his and the Fire Nation's honor. </p>
		 <p>While Aang defeated Ozai, Zuko, with the help of Katara, <i>defeated</i> <em><strong>his younger sister, Princess Azula</strong></em>, and took his place as Fire Lord. He also declaring the end of the Hundred Year War and the start of a new era of love and peace. Nevertheless, he succeeded in maintaining peace and eventually became one of the founders of the United Republic of Nations. Zuko stepped down from his position as Fire Lord and became an ambassador of peace, relinquishing the throne to his daughter, <b>Izumi.</b> </p>
		 <p>Zuko was the firstborn child of Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa. From a young age, he was disdained by his father due to lacking the "spark in [his] eyes" typical for firebenders.Indeed, Zuko would struggle to become a strong bender. However, he displayed a strong sense of empathy and morality from an very early point. As they got older, Zuko and Azula eventually grew apart, and he became the object of his sister's manipulation, ridicule, and deception. </p>

		 <h2>His Ability</h2>
		 <h4> 1. Firebending. 
		 While growing up in the Fire Nation, Zuko showed no extraordinary skill in firebending. As a child, Zuko could only create small bursts of flame and was by no means focused or controlled in his bending. He became able to fight on par with much more experienced firebenders, showing himself to be a late bloomer. Having continuously refined his skills, he has reached the point of becoming a firebending master, but despite his skill and fast development as a firebender, he has noted on more than one occasion that he is not as skilled or as powerful as his younger sister, Azula.</h4>

		 <h5> 2. Swordsmanship. 
		 	Aside from his bending, Zuko also developed a masterful skill in swordsmanship, and he specialized in dual wielding swordplay, using a set of dao blades, skills he gained after being trained by the swordmaster Piandao. He would use these skills as his primary tactics whenever he was in his <a href="#">Blue Spirit</a>   disguise, unable to firebend, or when he needed to fight but also needed to conceal his firebending. He was able to defeat multiple foes using only his swords, including experienced firebending soldiers. His swordsmanship skills is a combination with unarmed combat and, in the same confrontation, demonstrated the ability to combine his sword skills with his firebending, allowing him to deliver more powerful and destructive attacks. His skill was such that his father, Fire Lord Ozai, opted not to face him during an eclipse when neither of them could firebend. He also had some experience with knives, being able to pierce a small object, like a horn, from a distance. </h5>
